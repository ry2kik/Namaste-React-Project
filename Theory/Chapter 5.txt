1) Difference between dafault and named export:
	Default export:
		const func_name = () => {
			return <h1>Default Export</h1>;
		}
		export degault func_name;
	Named Export: 
		export const func_name = () => {
			return <h1>Named Export</h1>
		}	
	

2) config.js:
	config.js or constants.js file is used to store all the hard coded data stored in a variable. Like: RestaurentList, or image url.

3) React Hook:
	With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. 

4) useState:
	We need useState Hook to change the state of the variables because React doesn't track any other variable apart from Hook variables especially useState() variables.
